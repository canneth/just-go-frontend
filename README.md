  <h2>Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    This is my first crack at developing an entire web app, and this entire project is primarily a
    learning exercise in implementing a proper backend. This repo contains only the frontend of this
    web app. To view the corresponding backend repo,&nbsp;

  <h2>About the web app</h2>
  <p>
    I like going outside, be it to do some work at a cafe, read a book in a park or just to enjoy some quality
    time on my skateboard. The problem is that I often have a thing I wish to do in mind but not the place, and
    I end up spending more time deciding where to do the thing rather than actually doing the thing. Seeking a
    meaningful idea to build my first web app around, I figured this would make for an interesting problem to
    solve, and thus: JustGo!
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm sure that many people can agree that the allure of a certain place is heavily influenced by the weather.
    For myself, when deciding between places to go, I always consult the weather forecast for that location and
    check the island-wide (Singapore) rain radar map on&nbsp;
    <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.nea&hl=en_SG&gl=US' rel='noreferrer'>myENV</a>&nbsp;
    to see if it had rained within the last 30 minutes at that location.
    <br />
    <br />
    Switching between multiple apps and websites to gather all this information about the place just to decide if
    I'd like to go there is tedious and time-consuming.
    <br />
    <br />
    In this app, I attempt to create a user experience where all of this information is conveniently presented to
    help users spend less time pondering, and more time going!

  <h2>What can I do on this app?</h2>
  <p>
    Search for places and view real-time hyperlocal weather forecasts:
    <br />
    <code>TODO: Add a gif navigating, from the landing page, to the search page and searching for places</code>
    <br />
    <br />
    Create an account and curate your list of favourite haunts:
    <br />
    <code>TODO: Add a gif walking through the favouriting process from the search page</code>
    <br />
    <br />
    Want to go somewhere to do something? Browse your favourite places for your activity of choice:
    <br />
    <code>TODO: Add a gif navigating to the "I feel like..." page, choosing an option, then showing the corresponding results</code>
    <br />
    <br />
    View the chosen place on a map with a rain radar map overlay to check if the weather is in your favour:
    <br />
    <code>TODO: Add a gif clicking on a place card, with the ground map and the rain radar map over it</code>

  <h2>Development status</h2>
  <p>
    The web app is <strong>very incomplete</strong>, and is undergoing <strong>active development</strong>,
    meaning that what works today may break tomorrow, and vice versa.
